        <b>Giterrific</b> is an open-source JSON API server for information about git repositories.
        If you find yourself in need of a good JSON API to surface some information from a private
        git server, but don't wish to install or maintain a full GitLab setup (or something with a
        similar number of bells and whisles) then this is the app for you. For more information
        visit our <a href="https://github.com/farmdawgnation/giterrific">GitHub project.</a>
