# Giterrific

_A lightweight JSON API for private git servers._

Giterrific is a solution to a very silly problem: there doesn't exists (in as far as I could find)
a minimalist JSON API microservice that would surface information about git repositories in a sane
fashion. So, I wrote Giterrific.

Giterrific surfaces basic information about your private Git repositories in simple, easy to
consume, JSON APIs that don't require running a full GitLab or GitHub Enterprise setup. It's still
very much in alpha, so plan accordingly.

## Giterrific Server

The easiest way to use Giterrific Server for now is the Docker image. You can run it as follows:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /path/to/repos:/opt/docker/repos farmdawgnation/giterrific
```

This will boot a working Giterrific server that serves information about your git repositories.
After this is up and running you can start making calls against the endpoints that the server
exposes:

* `/api/v1/repos/:id/commits/:ref` - List the commits starting at a particular ref.
  * `:id` - The repository identifier.
  * `:ref` - The ref (branch name, commit sha, etc) to list commits from.
* `/api/v1/repos/:id/commits/:ref/tree[/path/to/subfolders]` - List the contents of folders.
  * If no subfolder path is provided it lists the contents of the root of the repo's working
    directory.
* `/api/v1/repos/:id/commits/:ref/contents/[path/to/file]` - Retrieve the content summary of a file.
  * The path must reference exactly one file.

## Giterrific Scala Bindings

If you use Scala and want to use Giterrific from your Scala app, we've provided language bindings
specifically for you! You'll find them under the `client/` folder. Using the client will require
providing an ExecutionContext and working with Futures.

```scala
// Import the client bindings
import giterrific.client._

// Set your execution context
implicit val ec = scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.global

// Declare a client
val client = new GiterrificClient("http://localhost:8080")

// Pick a repo
val testRepo = client.repo("testRepo")

// List commits on master
testRepo.withRef("master").getCommits()
testRepo.withRef("master").getCommits(skip = 0, maxCount = 20)

// List the root folder
testRepo.withRef("master").getTree()
// List the files folder
testRepo.withRef("master").withPath("files").getTree()

// Get the contents of hello.txt at the root
tesRepo.withRef("master").withPath("hello.txt").getContent()
```
